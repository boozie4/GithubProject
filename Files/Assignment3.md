## Configuration
1. * What are the commands to configure your user.name and your user.email?
* git config --global user.name "Your Name"
* git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
1. * Should this be configured globally or in your repo? Why or why not?
* It is typically recommended this be configured globally, as it simplifies a developers setup and ensures consistency accross multiple projects. The developers identity is easily and clearly associated with all of the work they put in.
